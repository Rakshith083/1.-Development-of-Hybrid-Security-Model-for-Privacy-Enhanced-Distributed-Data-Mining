# 1.-Development-of-Hybrid-Security-Model-for-Privacy-Enhanced-Distributed-Data-Mining
The hybrid model provides two levels of security. The first security level perturbs the individual datasets by transforming it into a non-understandable form using the four-dimensional rotation transformation, and the second security level helps in performing secure distributed data mining using the ratio of secure summation protocol. The trivial data mining techniques, such as na√Øve Bayes classification technique, verifies the efficiency and accuracy of the hybrid security model. The hybrid security model provides security to sensitive data without compromising the quality of the data.
